To Start the application run "yarn start"
If the application doesnt work it is because the bearer access token is expired. 

To make it work you will have to go here:
https://developer.spotify.com/console/get-search-item/?q=tania+bowra&type=artist

Click "Get Token" and log in to get a new bearer token
Add the token to the "accessToken" variable in App.js.

This should make the applicaiton run smoothly.

Search what ever your favorite artist is. 

Enjoy!!!
